		                <p>THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE TERMS ON WHICH INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RECORDS SYSTEMS, LLC (d/b/a INMERS LLC) (“INMERS”) OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO OUR HEALTH2.ME SERVICE. </p>
<p>
Thank you for choosing Health2.me. Please carefully review the following terms and conditions, which govern your use of our services available under or related to the domain and sub-domains of www.Inmers.us and www.Health2.me. and any associated mobile applications (our “Services”), including all content such as programs, modules, text, information presentation, site structure, source code and process flow (the “Content”), all Patient Information (as defined below) and all other information made available to you through www.Health2.me by INMERS or any other party. 
</p>

<p>
Your access to and use of the Services is subject to this User Agreement and constitutes your acknowledgement that you have read and accepted these terms, including the terms contained in our Privacy Policy, which explain what information we collect and how we use it. If you’re using our Services for an organization, you are agreeing to the User Agreement on behalf of that organization. If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this User Agreement, do not use or access our Services. The terms “you” and “your” in this Agreement refer to the individual or organization accessing the Health2.me site. The terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “INMERS” refers to International Medical Records Systems, LLC (d/b/a INMERS LLC), a Delaware limited liability company.
</p>

<p>
In accordance with Section 19, we may amend this User Agreement at any time by conspicuously posting notifications of the amended terms on the Health2.me homepage or by emailing you. By continuing to use or access the Services following the effectiveness of such modifications, you agree to follow and be bound by the revised User Agreement.
</p>

<p>
1. Eligibility.
Our Services are available only to individuals or organizations (or such party’s legal representative) that can form legally binding contracts under applicable law and for the use of medically-related purposes (e.g., medical evaluation, diagnosis, prevention or treatment, storage of Records (as such term is defined below) or other healthcare-related information, payment for past, present or future medical services, or for a purpose related to any of the foregoing) (each, a “Permitted Purpose”). If you are under the age of 18, unless otherwise legally permitted to do so (e.g., you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor child), your use of our Services is not permitted without the consent of your parent or legal guardian.
</p>

<p>
2. General Nature of Services; Limitations.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
IF YOU EXPERIENCE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, seek immediate professional medical attention outside of our Services (for example, by dialing 911 or visiting the emergency room nearest you).
</strong>
</p>

<p>
INMERS, through www.Health2.me, assists patients and medical professionals obtain, transmit and manage patients’ health and medical records. These records may include, without limitation, images, written reports, drawings, configurations, data, patient consents or waivers, and other medical information or content specific to individual patients (“Records”). While INMERS strives to facilitate communication among healthcare providers and create convenience in patients’ and medical professionals’ ability to access such Records, they are provided for informational purposes only, and INMERS does not verify, certify, guarantee or warrant the accuracy, inclusiveness or completeness of any Record. In addition, while medical providers have the ability to use our Services to communicate with and monitor the status of patients in real-time (for example, by automated phone probe), they may not or may not always do so. If you are a patient, consult with your medical provider to ensure whether or how he or she utilizes our Services. Do not rely solely on our Services to contact your medical provider on your behalf and, if you are unable to reach your medical provider using our Services, contact him or her using an alternate means. 
</p>

<p>
Neither INMERS nor Health2.me practices medicine, and neither INMERS nor Health2.me provide medical advice or render medical services.
</p>

<p>
3. Fees and Services.
The annual subscription fee and set-up costs may be viewed at: http://www.inmers.us/pricing. We may change our fees or our Service offerings from time to time, but no fee change will apply to you until the next renewal of your subscription. 
</p>

<p>
4. Identity Verification.
We require a username and password to help guarantee secure access to our site. You agree that (a) you will not falsely state, impersonate or otherwise misrepresent your identity or create an account for anyone other than yourself or your organization; (b) you will not provide any false information on Health2.me; (c) if we disable or terminate your account, you will not create another without our permission; (d) you will keep your contact information accurate and up to date; and (e) you will not share your password or let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account. You further agree you are solely responsible for: (y) maintaining the strict confidentiality of your username and password and (z) promptly informing INMERS in writing of the need to deactivate a username resulting from actual or potential security concerns. You release INMERS and our officers, directors, agents, affiliates and employees from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) (each a “Claim”) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with a Claim that arises from our inability to confirm user identity other than such Claims that result solely and directly from INMERS’s breach of this User Agreement, gross negligence or willful misconduct.
</p>

<p>
5. Unauthorized Use.
You are responsible for anything that happens through your account (including any losses or damages incurred by third parties) occurring or accruing prior to your termination of your account or your notification to us that your account security was compromised due to no fault of your own. You agree to indemnify us and hold us harmless for all damages, losses and costs (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs) related to all third party claims, charges and investigations, caused by your failure to comply with this User Agreement or any activity in which you engage on or through Health2.me.
</p>

<p>
6. Information Control.
We do not control all information provided by users and made available through our system. You may find other users’ information to be incomplete, inaccurate, offensive or inapplicable. Please use caution when using our site.
</p>

<p>
7. Breach of Terms and Conditions or Fraudulent Activity.
We may, at our sole discretion and without notice to you, review your conduct and all Patient Information for compliance with this User Agreement and our Privacy Policy. Without limiting any other remedies, we may issue you a warning, remove any Patient Information, temporarily or indefinitely suspend your user access or terminate your account, and refuse to provide our Services to you immediately if: (a) you breach this User Agreement or any document it incorporates by reference; (b) we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; (c) we believe that your actions may cause financial loss or legal liability for you, our other users or us; or (d) if we suspect that you (by conviction, settlement, insurance or escrow investigation, or otherwise) have engaged in fraudulent activity in connection with our site. 
</p>

<p>
8. Patient Information.
8.1 Definition. “Patient Information” is defined as any Record or other information uploaded or otherwise provided to us or other users about a patient through Health2.me, including via email, chat, video or other communication feature associated with Health2.me. As between the patient and INMERS, the patient owns all Patient Information and may request its deletion in writing at any time, unless (a) it has been shared with other users and such users have not deleted it, (b) it was copied and stored by other users, or (c) its deletion is prohibited or limited by law (for example, by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996). By providing such information, you certify (1) the Patient Information you provide is personal to you, to someone for whom you have legal responsibility or to someone from whom you have legal authority and (2) you have all rights power, and authority (and have obtained all necessary consents) required to provide such information to Health2.me and allow it to be shared with other users. You certify that the Patient Information you provide is correct and complete to the best of your knowledge and that all information you provide is for a Permitted Purpose. By providing Patient Information to Health2.me, you confirm you are granting permission for users to share such information with other users for a Permitted Purpose. 
</p>

<p>
In the event of termination of your subscription of Health2.me, you must download, backup or otherwise save all Patient Information you wish to retain within 180 days of such termination. You acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise required by law, INMERS will have no obligation to maintain any Patient Information for more than 180 days from the date of termination of your subscription. 
</p>

<p>
8.2 Restricted Activities. You, any Patient Information you provide and your activities on the site will not: (a) be false, inaccurate, misleading or fraudulent; (b) be used for any purpose except a Permitted Purpose; (c) infringe any third party’s copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (d) violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation; (e) be defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing; (f) be obscene; (g) contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, easter eggs or other computer programming routines that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or information, or interfere with or disrupt any user, host, or network, for example by sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing any part of the Services; (h) create liability for us or cause us to lose (in whole or in part) the services of our internet service providers or other suppliers; (i) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network; (j) breach or otherwise circumvent any security or authentication measures; (k) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas or parts of the Services, or shared areas of the Services to which you have not been granted access; (l) access or search the Services by any means other than our publicly supported interfaces (for example, “scraping”); (m) send unsolicited communications, promotions or advertisements, or spam; (n) send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information, including “spoofing” or “phishing”; (o) promote or advertise products or services without our prior, written authorization (p) publish or share any materials not intended to be used for a Permitted Purpose (including any such materials that are pornographic or indecent, or that advocate bigotry, religious, racial or ethnic hatred); (q) violate the law in any way including storing, publishing or sharing material that is fraudulent, defamatory, misleading, or that violates the privacy or infringes the rights of others; (r) use Health2.me to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious or discriminatory; or (s) seek, provide or obtain diagnosis, treatment, a medical opinion, or specific medical advice as applied to a patient’s particular condition or situation solely via the Services (including via Health2.me). 
</p>

<p>
8.3 License to Patient Information. Upon transmission of Patient Information to Health2.me, and solely to enable INMERS to use the information you supply to provide the Services, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free right to exercise the rights you have in the Patient Information. You hereby grant us permission to host Patient Information on our system, back it up, and allow users to share it with others for a Permitted Purpose. Because our Services provide many features (including the ability to view high quality images, document previews, and the ability to sort, edit, share and search Patient Information) that require our systems to store, access, and scan Patient Information, you give us (and trusted third parties we may work with) permission to do those things. We will not use or employ Patient Information for any purposes other than those described in this User Agreement and in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We will not materially change Patient Information so as to make it inaccurate, but may sort, extract and aggregate information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Other than as set forth in this User Agreement or the Privacy Policy, INMERS will have no right, title and ownership in Patient Information, and you will retain all rights, title and ownership or license you may have in Patient Information.
</p>

<p>
While our Services add a social aspect that allows for enhanced medical care, you should consider carefully what you wish to share, since once such information is shared with other users it is beyond our control.
</p>

<p>
8.4 Your License to Health2.me. During the term of your subscription to Health2.me, you are granted a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited license to use Health2.me in accordance with this User Agreement and our Privacy Policy for the Permitted Purpose. You agree not to: (a) sell, lease, or modify the Content; (b) decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or make derivative works of the Content; (c) remove any confidentiality, privacy, patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices in the Content; (d) copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, or publicly display or “mirror” any Content (excluding Patient Information) without our prior written permission; or (e) transfer any of the Content to another person or entity in a manner inconsistent with this User Agreement. We may in our sole discretion change some or all of the Services without notice to you. You agree only to use or access Health2.me for a Permitted Purpose in accordance with this User Agreement and our Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
8.5 Property Rights. You acknowledge and agree that INMERS owns and retains all right, title and ownership of the Services and to Health2.me and its Content (including all modifications, revisions and derivative works, and all programs, enhancements, design concepts and other documentation, developed for or relating to Health2.me, but excluding your rights in Patient Information).
</p>

<p>
8.6 Confidential Information. INMERS agrees to keep Patient Information, user names and passwords in confidence and will not disclose the foregoing to any person or party, except to (a) you, medical professionals and their agents, or other users of Health2.me for a Permitted Purpose (in the case of Patient Information); (b) contractors, attorneys or consultants who are obligated by agreement or professional codes of conduct to preserve the confidentiality and observe the use restrictions of this Agreement or an agreement providing equivalent protection, and (c) as required by a subpoena or similar demand of a governmental entity, following notice to you (to the extent we are allowed to provide such notice).  
</p>

<p>
If an unauthorized use or disclosure of Patient Information by INMERS occurs, INMERS will (a) take reasonable steps to recover and prevent further disclosure of the disclosed data, (b) with respect to any information that is subject to a law requiring notice to you or a third party of such unauthorized disclosure, take those steps required to comply with such notice or other requirements under such laws, and (c) implement reasonable controls to prevent subsequent unauthorized use or disclosure and explain those controls to you at your request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of patient information by INMERS, INMERS will comply with all applicable requirements of HIPAA, the Texas Medical Records Privacy Law and any other applicable law.
</p>

<p>
9. Third-Party Information and External Links.  
Our Services may include listings of medical professionals or hyperlinks to other sites. These materials, which may not be error-free or comprehensive (or, in the case of other sites, under the control of INMERS), are provided for your convenience only. INMERS is not responsible for, nor does it verify, certify, evaluate, endorse or recommend the content of any listing, linked site or any link contained in a non-affiliated linked site. If you decide to access any listing or links to third party sites via Health2.me, you do so at your own risk.  
</p>

<p>
10. Feedback.
We encourage you to submit feedback or suggestions to admin@inmers.us. 
</p>

<p>
11. Privacy.
We view protection of users’ privacy as a very important community principle. You should carefully read our full Privacy Policy, located at https://www.health2.me/legal/privacy.html and incorporated into this User Agreement by reference, before using Health2.me. We will use Patient Information only in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Because we understand clearly that Patient Information is among your most important assets, we store and process Patient Information on computers protected by physical as well as technological security devices that meet or exceed industry standards. If you object to Patient Information being used in this way, do not use our Services. 
</p>

<p>
12. No Warranty.
WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLIERS PROVIDE HEALTH2.ME, THE CONTENT, OUR SERVICES, AND ALL PATIENT INFORMATION “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. WE DO NOT CONTROL OR EXAMINE THE QUANTITY OR QUALITY OF CARE OR SERVICE PROVIDED BY ANY MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, NOR DO WE CONTROL OR EXAMINE USER-GENERATED INFORMATION (INCLUDING PATIENT INFORMATION) FOR ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MEDICAL DECISION OR DIAGNOSIS MADE USING OUR SERVICES, OR OPERATOR OR OTHER ERRORS OCCURRING IN OR DURING DATA ENTRY, THE COPYING, IMPORTING OR OTHER MANIPULATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION, THE CREATION OF NEW RECORDS, OR OMISSIONS OR INCOMPLETENESS OF ANY DATA OR PATIENT INFORMATION. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE OR SECURE ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES, AND OPERATION OF OUR SITE MAY BE INTERFERED WITH BY NUMEROUS FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY OF DATA AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE, AND MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES FOR THE DELIVERY OF ANY COMMUNICATION USING THE HEALTH2.ME SITE TO ANYONE. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you. You may also have other legal rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. 
</p>

<p>
13. Liability Limit.
IN NO EVENT SHALL WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, EMPLOYEES OR OUR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SITE, OUR SERVICES OR THIS USER AGREEMENT (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
</p>

<p>
OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY, AND THE LIABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, EMPLOYEES, AND SUPPLIERS, TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF FEES YOU PAY TO US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. 
</p>

<p>
IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, YOU ADDITIONALLY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE §1542, WHICH SAYS: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. 
</p>

<p>
14. Indemnity.
You agree to indemnify and hold us and (as applicable) our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this User Agreement or the documents it incorporates by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.

17. How We May Contact You; Notices.
When you visit www.Health2.me or send e-mail to us, you are communicating with us electronically. Accordingly, you explicitly consent to receive communications from us electronically. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. Additionally, you agree that we may communicate with you through your Health2.me account (including by posting notices on our site) or through other means including email, telephone, or delivery services including the postal service about your account with us or regarding our associated services. If you provide us with your mobile phone number, you grant us permission to place calls or send SMS (text) messages to that number, including by automated processes, and acknowledge that you are responsible for any text-message fees that may apply. You may control and limit what kind of messages you receive from us by reviewing and adjusting your account settings. We will not transmit Records or other personal health information by unsecured electronic means. You acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability associated with or arising from your failure to maintain accurate contact or other information, including, but not limited to, your failure to receive critical information about the Services. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile account, you must promptly update your Health2.me account information to ensure that messages intended for you are not sent to the person that acquires your old number and failure to do so is your responsibility.
</p>

<p>
Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any legal notices will be given to INMERS by email to admin@inmers.us and to you by email to the email address you provide to INMERS during the registration process. Notice will be deemed given 24 hours after the email is sent, unless the sending party is notified that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give you notice by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to the address provided to INMERS during the registration process. In such case, notice will be deemed given 3 days after the date of mailing. 
</p>

<p>
18. Arbitration.
Any legal controversy or legal claim arising out of or relating to this User Agreement or our Services, excluding legal action taken by INMERS to collect our fees and/or recover damages for, or obtain an injunction relating to, the Health2.me site operations, intellectual property, and our Services, will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such controversy or claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration shall be conducted in Dallas, Texas, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction thereof. Either you or INMERS may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Dallas, Texas necessary to protect the rights or property of you or INMERS pending the completion of arbitration. Should either party file an action contrary to this provision, the other party may recover its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
</p>

<p>
19. Additional Terms.
We may change our policies from time to time and any changes are effective ten (10) days after we post them on our site. In addition, you agree that you are subject to any posted policies or rules applicable to any Services you use, which may be posted on Health2.me from time to time. All posted policies or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into this User Agreement. 
</p>

<p>
20. Special Provisions Applicable to Users Outside the United States.
If you interact with Health2.me outside the United States, you acknowledge, agree, and consent that any information you provide, including Patient Information, may be transferred to and processed by a computer server located within the United States, and subject to United States laws and regulations. Further, if you access this website from outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local or national laws, rules or regulations applicable to such use. Do not use our Services if you are prohibited from receiving products, services, or software originating from the United States.
</p>

<p>
21. Payment
By providing your credit card or other payment information for payment of our Services you agree to allow us to store your payment information. You also agree to pay the applicable fees for Services as they become due plus all related taxes, and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. Failure to pay may result in the suspension or termination of your account. If applicable, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices, including because of exchange rates. If the payment method you use for the Services, such as a credit card, reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel your account, you authorize us to suspend your account or to continue billing that payment method, and you will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. Your obligation to pay fees continues through the end of the subscription period during which you cancel your subscription. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase. You may cancel [or suspend] your subscription by emailing us at admin@inmers.us. No refunds or credits will be extended for lack of usage or dissatisfaction.
</p>

<p>
22. General.
This User Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Texas as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Texas between Texas residents. If any provision of this User Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and the remaining provisions, together with a valid, enforceable replacement provision, will be enforced. You agree that this User Agreement and all incorporated agreements may be automatically assigned by INMERS, in our sole discretion, to a third party in the event of a merger or acquisition. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.
