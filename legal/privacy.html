Our site collects the information required when you sign up for our services, as well as information that users voluntarily provide or have provided on their behalf, including personal and confidential healthcare or other information about a user (“User Information”), that we may associate with a specific account. Examples of User Information include but are not limited to basic identification and demographic information (such as name, birthdate, and gender), contact information (such as phone number, mobile phone number (if provided), and email or physical addresses), unique identifiers (such as username, password or identification number), health records (including but not limited to medical reports, images and audiovisual materials and test results), insurance information, financial or payment information, other personal and confidential information, user contacts and your activities and interactions with Health2.me. We may receive information about you from medical professionals and other users, such as when they make a referral or submit a medical record about you. When you post content on Health2.me, we may also extract, aggregate and analyze additional data related to such content (metadata), such as the name of the patient or medical professional, and time, date and place with respect to the record.

</p>

<p>
If you are on our mobile website or accessing the site through our mobile application, you may be asked whether you want us to access your geographic location based on the location of your mobile device. If you select ‘yes’ and save that setting, we may access and collect that data and use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Any information you submit to us that constitutes “Protected Health Information,” as defined by HIPAA, is subject to HIPAA and HITECH. The term “Protected Health Information” refers to personally identifiable information about your past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, the provision of health care to you or the past, present or future payment for such care. To the extent any information collected on this website constitutes Protected Health Information, then our HIPAA and HITECH compliant privacy practices will apply. We are also subject to certain state laws and the laws of jurisdictions outside of the United States regarding health information privacy and security.  To the extent those laws are applicable to any information collected via Health2.me, our policies developed under those additional laws will apply to that information.
</p>

<p>
Social Security Number Protection Policy
It is our policy to protect the confidentiality of Social Security numbers (“SSNs”) that we receive or collect in the course of providing our services to you. We secure the confidentiality of SSNs through various means, including physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards that are designed to protect against unauthorized access.  In accordance with industry standards, we limit access to SSNs to that which is lawful, and to prohibit unlawful disclosure of SSNs.

<p>
How We Use User Information
</p>

<p>
Generally
User Information is supplied at the user’s discretion and will be used only as specified herein. We collect, store, process and relay User Information and metadata related to User Information for a variety of purposes, including to verify a user’s identity, to transmit medical records to other users and for other appropriate medically-related purposes (e.g., medical evaluation, diagnosis, prevention or treatment, storage of medical records or other healthcare-related information, payment for past, present or future medical services, or for a purpose related to any of the foregoing) (each, a “Medical Purpose”), to allow database linkage and interface, provide reporting capability, to allow for record keeping and tracking of data, for use as account information in our system, for the operation of Health2.me and for other internal operations (such as troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement). 
</p>

<p>
We may combine personal information that you provide us through the Health2.me website with other personal information held by INMERS. 
</p>

<p>

If you provide us with your mobile phone number, you grant us permission to place calls or send SMS (text) messages to that number, including by automated processes, and acknowledge that you are responsible for any text-message fees that may apply. You may control and limit what kind of messages you receive from us by reviewing and adjusting your account settings.
</p>

Certain features may let you, or a medical professional on your behalf, make additional information (such as notes based on medical records) available to other users. When your information is shared for a Medical Purpose, that person will have access to your contact information because it will be displayed with your medical record information. That user may use that information to communicate with you regarding your medical evaluation, diagnosis or treatment, or may further share such information with other users for a Medical Purpose.

</p>

<p>
